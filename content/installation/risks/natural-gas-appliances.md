1) The information that follows from Donnay Detoxicology LLC contains links to collections of peerreviewed articles about carbon monoxide that open webpages of the US National Library of Medicine at [http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.](http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.) From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X")

### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### NATURAL GAS APPLIANCES 

These may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because the emit very high levels of CO and are commonly either not vented (such gas ovens and ranges) or inadequately vented (such as gas water heaters with open flue “collars”). Even appliances built with sealed combustion and direct vents may emit CO into a home if a leak develops in the combustion chamber prior to the vent. 

For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the 

**CO levels found in homes with natural gas appliances** , see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/DonnayDetoxicologyLLC/collections/61813402/public/ 

and the **inhaled CO poisoning caused by natural gas appliances,**
