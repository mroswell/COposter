#### DISCLOSURE AND DISCLAIMER 

1) The information that follows from Donnay Detoxicology LLC contains links to collections of peerreviewed articles about carbon monoxide that open webpages of the US National Library of Medicine at [http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.](http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.) From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X") 

4) By clicking on the links provided below to any of Donnay's collections, you acknowledge this disclosure and agree not to hold Albert Donnay or Donnay Detoxicology LLC responsible for any false, misleading, or outdated information that the selected articles may contain.

### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### GASOLINE VEHICLES 

Gasoline vehicles may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because their exhaust contains a high level of CO, in the range of 50,000 to 200,000ppm before the catalytic converter starts working (typically within 1 to 2 minutes) and then 200 to 500 ppm when the catalytic is working. Diesel vehicles emit much fewer than 200 ppm at the tailpipe. 

CO from exhaust may enter both moving and parked vehicle from the engine via air ducts, open windows, or any unplugged holes or leaking seams into the cabin (especially if these openings are near the tailpipe, such as the around trunks and hatchbacks). 

Occupants of any type of enclosed vehicle–gas, diesel, or electric–may be poisoned by CO entering their cabin from vehicles around them.
