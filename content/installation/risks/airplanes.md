#### DISCLOSURE AND DISCLAIMER 

1) The information that follows from Donnay Detoxicology LLC contains links to collections of peerreviewed articles about carbon monoxide that open webpages of the US National Library of Medicine at [http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.](http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.) From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X") 

4) By clicking on the links provided below to any of Donnay's collections, you acknowledge this disclosure and agree not to hold Albert Donnay or Donnay Detoxicology LLC responsible for any false, misleading, or outdated information that the selected articles may contain.

### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### AIRPLANES 

Airplanes may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because CO and other byproducts of incomplete combustion can enter the cabin from several sources, including from: 

1. the “bleed air” that continuously comes into modern jets while in flight via their engines and which may be contaminated with partially burned engine oil; 2 the Auxiliary Power Unit, a gas-powered generator that operates when the plane is on the ground and during taking off and landings; and 

3. the exhaust of other planes, especially when taxiing behind planes with tail-mounted engines. For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the **CO levels measured in airplanes** , see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/DonnayDetoxicologyLLC/collections/54592647/public/
