## CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

## GAS AND WOOD FIREPLACES 

#### These may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if they are not vented to the outside (a 

#### common problem with gas log “fire sets”), or if they backdraft when cooling down 

#### overnight (a common problem with wood fireplaces that lack the tight fitting glass doors 

#### needed to prevent backdrafting). 

#### For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the 

#### CO levels associated with fireplaces, see:
