From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X")

### CARBON MONOXIDE CONDITIONS: 

### HEART DAMAGE 

Heart damage may by caused by either inhaled and/or internal carbon monoxide poisoning. 

[Note that most internal CO comes from the breakdown of heme proteins by heme oxygenase-1 and -2. Along with CO, this process releases equal parts of ferritin, bilirubin, and hydrogen along with 3 parts of water. While exposure to high levels of CO causes symptoms of CO poisoning, exposure to very low levels is also unhealthy and causes symptoms of CO deficiency.]
