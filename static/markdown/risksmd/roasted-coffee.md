1) The information that follows from Donnay Detoxicology LLC contains links to collections of peerreviewed articles about carbon monoxide that open webpages of the US National Library of Medicine at [http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.](http://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.) From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X")

### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### SMELLING ROASTED COFFEE 

This may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because roasted coffee beans and grind release a very high level of CO as they cool. While modern packages contain a pressure relief valve that allows some of this CO to escape, they still release over 1000 parts per million when first opened. 

In comparison, the US NIOSH recommends the immediate evacuation of any workplace over 200ppm and says levels over 1200ppm are “immediately dangerous to life and health.” 

For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the CO levels released by roasted coffee, see:
