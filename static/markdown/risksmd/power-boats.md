From the PubMed site--over which Donnay Detoxicology LLC has no control--you can save or export the articles in the collections. 

2) The articles in each collection were selected by Albert Donnay, a consulting toxicologist who has specialized in CO poisoning since 1999. He selected the articles for their relevance to the topics and not for their accuracy, integrity, clinical utility, or any other reason. 

3) The collections are not regularly updated and so only should be considered illustrative, not exhaustive. To find more recent articles on any topic "X", you can search at [http://www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov) for ("carbon monoxide" and "X")

### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### POWER BOATS 

Power boats may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because their exhaust contains a high level of CO. Boaters also may be poisoned by inadequately vented “gensets” or portable generators. Note the CO alarms built for marine use to the UL2034M standard—like UL2034 home CO alarms--are not designed to prevent poisoning only deaths. By the time they alarm anyone in the area has already been poisoned. 

For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the CO poisonings caused by power boats and marine gensets, see
