### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### UNLINED CHIMNEYS AND ATTACHED GARAGES 

These may cause carbon monoxide poisoning because they allow exhaust gases to enter a building without warning. 

To prevent poisoning from these risks, all chimneys should have a stainless-steel liner and all attached garages used to store vehicles with combustion engines should have 100 cubic feet per minute of continuous exhaust ventilation for each vehicle, as section 404.3 of the International Mechanical Code requires.
