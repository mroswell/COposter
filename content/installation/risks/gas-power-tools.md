### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### GAS POWER TOOLS 

Gas power tools of all kinds may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if they lack a catalytic converter that converts carbon monoxide to less harmful carbon dioxide. Those without a catalytic converter emit much more CO than gasoline powered vehicles with working converters. 

Among the gas power tools that have been reported to poison people with CO are lawnmowers, leaf blowers, snow blowers, chainsaws, and floor buffers. 

For a collection of peer-reviewed articles on PubMed curated by Albert Donnay about the **CO poisoning caused by gas power tools** , see:
