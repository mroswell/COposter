### CARBON MONOXIDE RISK FACTORS: 

### SMOKING ANYTHING 

Smoking causes carbon monoxide poisoning in non-smokers who are not habituated to high levels of exposure. 

Depending on what and how people smoke, they are inhaling CO in the range of low 100s to low 1000s of parts per million (ppm). Within one hour after they stop smoking, their exhaled levels are typically below 50ppm. 

In contrast, the US EPA limit for the public is only 9ppm average, the US OSHA limit for workers is 50ppm average, home CO alarms warn over 70ppm, and US NIOSH says CO levels over 1200ppm are “immediately dangerous to life and health.”
